        <strong><u>Charles Wheatstone:</u></strong>
        In 1838 Mr. Wheatstone, an English inventor and scientist discovered that if two pictures were drawn from slightly different perspectives and placed
        in front of a subject's eyes then it would be pieced together and be viewed in three dimensions by the user's brain.
        <br>
        Using this newfound knowledge he set out to invent something to make the phenomena possible more often, the
        Stereoscope was born.
        <br>

        <br>
        This device is the first type of virtual reality, and unlike today's graphically intensive
        ones it didn't use computers <em>(also computers weren't out yet)</em>. However, just like modern virtual reality
        machines, this one shared the same goal of immersing the user in another world.
        <br><br>
        Stereoscopes can still be found today as toys in the waiting room at doctor's offices, showing the design's longevity.
        Many iterations have been invented over the years and can be found today. If you'd like more information,

    <strong><u>The Digitization of Virtual Reality</u></strong>
    <br>
    In the early 1960's American internet pioneer and computer scientist Ivan Sutherland presented his idea of the
        "absolute display" - a display comprised of monitors that could situate the user in total perceptual immersion.
        While being a professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts he created the first rendition of modern
        augmented / virtual reality with his students, using his aformentioned idea.</p>

            <p> This machine was dubbed "Sword of Damocles as a joke by Professor Sutherland.
                Due to its immense weight it had to be suspended from the ceiling.</p>
