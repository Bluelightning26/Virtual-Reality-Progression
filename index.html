            Hello there, I'm a high schooler that's based in the United States. Here you will find a blog-post-esque website
        designed to inform the reader (<strong>you</strong>) about how virtual reality as we know of it today has come
        to be. Immersion in a faux 3D world isn't just a modern day thing and has been done in various ways throughout
        the centuries. Stick along to learn a plethora about the technology since its discovery in the 1800s by Charles Wheaton.
        Since Wheaton's discoveries Virtual reality has become far more advanced with a plethora of headsets from various
        brands emerging in the past decade.
