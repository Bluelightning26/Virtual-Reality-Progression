        <em>A computer generated simulation used to model a 3D environment that can be pieced together by the brain.</em>
        That's my interpretation of today's standard definition of Virtual reality.

        Reality and falseness generally don't go together. Virtual reality attempts to bridge this gap to immerse the
        user into a faux world by taking advantage of their five senses. Sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch can all be employed to deceive
        the user's brain. With today's level of technology sight and hearing are commonly the only senses that are taken
        advantage of to immerse the user. The future seems bright, with more investments being put towards further developing
        for the use of other immersive senses too every year!
